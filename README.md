# REST

REST: a RNA 3'End Sequencing data analysis Toolkit. 

#### 0. Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- BEDTOOLS
- DNABERT (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT)
- featureCounts (only required for count)

Download the REST with GitHub or manually \
`git clone https://github.com/christear/REST.git`

To run REST, plese install DNABERT firstly with the below codes, indeally under the directory of REST \
`conda create -n rest python=3.6` \
`conda activate rest` \
`conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch` \
to run with GPU, please use this for pytorch \
`conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia` 

Download DNABERT with GitHub or manually \
`git clone https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT.git` \
`cd DNABERT` \
`python3 -m pip install --editable . ` \
please use the dnabert.requirements.txt rather than the one under DNABERT/examples \
`python3 -m pip install -r ../dnabert.requirements.txt`

After sucessfuly install of DNABERT, install other required packages for REST \
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

To retrain the model (PASBERT) for polyadenylation site (PAS) analysis , please download the initial pretrained DNABERT model as mentioned in (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT)

To directly predict/filter true PAS, please download our finetuned model from Google Driver  (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ns28TP24QpTPqTX-JeYSd92iNG-ZTS2q?usp=share_link)

#### 1. Introduction
The REST is a toolkit for RNA 3'End Sequencing data analysis, which could be applied on both bulk RNA-seq data from mutiple 3'End Sequencing methods and common Single cell sequencing (SC-seq) data, including 10X genomics Chromium System.

The tools has been tested on:

1, 3'End Sequencing data from Lexogen QuanSeq 3' mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit REV (https://www.lexogen.com/quantseq-3mrna-sequencing-rev/)

2, SC-seq data from 10X genomics Chomium System (https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/chromium-x-series)

#### 2. Getting Started
The REST includes several key functions (some are still under development/debugging). \

1. call_cluster: call cluster based on 3' end-seq data based on the method described in previous study[1,2]. \

2. filter_cluster: filter the cluster based on sequence features fine-tuned by the DNABERT model. It has two options, including 'retrain' or 'pred'. \
- The 'retrain' option will fine-tune a pre-trained DNABERT model based on the identified cluster and annotation to define true/false PAS as well as an active-learning-based strategy to re-label true/false for each round of prediction. Finally, A fine-tuned model (PASBERT) will be returned. \
- The pred option will predict the true/false PAS for each cluster based on a fine-tuned model (PASBERT). \

3. merge_cluster: merge the filtered cluster from multiple samples and refine the peak based on the most frequent position across multiple samples. \

4. annotate_cluster: annotation PAS with a gene annotation GTF file as described in a previous study[3].
 
#### 3. Tutorial
The details of each function are shown below. 

1. call cluster based on RNA 3'End Sequencing data, required input should be in bam or bed format. The method was derived from the previous publications [1-2]. 
	- `python rest.py call_cluster --input_file [input.file] --input_format [bam/bed] --strand 2 --output [output.cluster] --output_dis [cluster.distance]`

2. filter reliable clusters as putative polyadenylation sites (PASs)
	
	a. retrain/fune-tune a pre-trained DNABERT model to the PASBERT model 
	- `python rest.py filter_cluster --run train --DNABERT_path [DNABERT.path] --input_file [input.cluster] --out_dir [output.dir] --reference [reference.genome] --annotation [pas.annotation] --model [pre-trained.DNABERT.model] --round 5 --kmer 5 --motif_file human.pas.motif`
	
	b. predict based on the pre-trained PASBERT model  
	- `python rest.py filter_cluster --run pred --DNABERT_path [DNABERT.path] --input_file [input.cluster] --out_dir [output.dir]  --model [model] --reference [reference.genome]`

3. merge the cluster passed PASBERT filtering from multiple samples
	- `python rest.py merge_cluster --file_list [file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt...] --read 5 --sam_num 2 --distance 25 --output [merged.pas.txt]`

4. count the sequencing reads for each putative PAS (under development)
	
	a. bulk RNA-seq data 
	- `python rest.py count_bulk -bam [bam.file] -i [input.cluster] -o [output.count] -s [strandness] --win [width]`
	
	b. SC-seq data 
	- `python rest.py count_sc -bam [bam.file] -i [input.cluster] -o [output.count] -s [strandness] --win [width] -f [output.type/count or usage]`

5. APA analyis (under development)
	
	a. APA analysis
	- `python rest.py apa -i [input.count.tab] -c [condition.file] -o [output.apa.events] -a [condition.a] -b [condition.b]`
	
	a. weighted 3' UTR length index (WULI) analysis 
	- `python rest.py wuli -i [input.count.tab] -c [condition.file] -o [output.apa.events] -a [condition.a] -b [condition.b]`
